    I met a friend, said I had a surprise,
    Said, "Hey, check this out, it's nothin' but wise."
    Sent them a link, said, "Trust me, it's great!"
    Little did they know, it was a rickroll bait.

    Never gonna give you up, never gonna let you down,
    Never gonna run around and desert you,
    Never gonna make you cry, never gonna say goodbye,
    Never gonna tell a lie and hurt you.

    They clicked that link, and what did they see?
    Rick Astley dancing, oh, what a glee!
    They screamed, "You got me, you sly little devil!"
    I just laughed and said, "It's a classic, my level."

    Never gonna give you up, never gonna let you down,
    Never gonna run around and desert you,
    Never gonna make you cry, never gonna say goodbye,
    Never gonna tell a lie and hurt you.

    They fell for the prank, a rickroll delight,
    A timeless joke that's sure to excite.
    No matter the era, it'll never grow old,
    A pop sensation, the story unfolds.
    
    Never gonna give you up, never gonna let you down,
    Never gonna run around and desert you,
    Never gonna make you cry, never gonna say goodbye,
    Never gonna tell a lie and hurt you.

    So next time you send a link, be aware,
    The rickroll's lurking, it's everywhere.
    Embrace the laughter, the unexpected surprise,
    Rickrolling forever, it'll never demise.</pre>
